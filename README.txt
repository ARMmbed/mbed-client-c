mbed Device C Client Library 2.3

The mbed Device C Client Library provides a simple and efficient way to create mbed Device Client in 
C. In addition to the libCoap library, several examples of mbed Device C Client Library endpoints are 
included. See the documentation in /docs for details on using the library, and the README in each example 
for details on running the examples.
