NanoService C Device Library 1.9

The NanoService C Device Library provides a simple and efficient way to create NanoService endpoints in 
C. In addition to the libCoap library, several examples of NanoService endpoints are included. See the 
documentation in /docs for details on using the library, and the README in each example for details on 
running the examples.
