## Deprecation note!

**Please note: this repository is deprecated and is no longer actively maintained**.

However, this library is part of Arm's [Mbed Cloud](https://cloud.mbed.com/docs/current) offering and as such the code is available via [Mbed Cloud Client](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cloud-client) under
[mbed-client](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cloud-client/tree/master/mbed-client) folder. That repository is actively maintained.

## The mbed Device C Client Library provides a simple and efficient way to create mbed Device Client in C.

Applications not using mbed-coap via mbedOS should add mbed-coap library either via mbed-coap.lib or via other
applicable means.
