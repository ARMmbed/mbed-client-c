ETSI CoAP Test Server for libCoAP (zach@sensinode.com)

This project is an ETSI Plugtest CoAP server, which verifies the correctness of the CoAP protocol implementation against other 
CoAP clients. Use the Sensinode Java ETSI test tools (etsi-test-tools-v0.6) and the associated scripts to test aginst this server. 


Compilation:

This software supports both Linux and MAC OSX builds, controlled by the "OS =" line of Makefile. 
Set this line to "LINUX" for Linux OSs and to "MACOSX" for Macs. 

To build the software type:

make


Usage:

etsi-server [-p 8000] 
-p	port to listen on (default = 8000)
-d	NSP IPv6 address (default = ::1)
-dp NSP port number (default = 5683)
-dtls DTLS proxy port (flag to run in DTLS mode, default port = 8001)


ETSI Plugtest:

Currently the following ETSI tests are supported.

- All CORE tests 01-16 except 14-15 where retransmission is required
- LINK test 01 (TODO: test 02 requires filtering on the rt= query parameter)

To run these tests using the Java test tools:

cd etsi-test-tools-v0.6
./TD_COAP_CORE_01 [::1]:8000
./TD_COAP_CORE_02 [::1]:8000
etc.


Known Limitations:

- IPv4 not supported
